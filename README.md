# Metrics for Benchmarking Localization Systems (Lometric)

Lometric repository provides Matlab sources of the evaluation method for localization systems, mainly targeted to mobile robotics.

Currently provided implementation:
* ATE_t - (example script: trajectoryEvaluationExample.m) Evaluation of the translation error using two different alignments
